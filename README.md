# Deep-Learning-Image-Classification

**Authors**: Afonso Alem√£o, Rui Daniel

## Overview
This project aims to provide hands-on experience with various fundamental techniques in deep learning, particularly focusing on image classification and multi-layer perceptrons.

## Content
### Question 1: Image Classification with Linear Classifiers and Neural Networks
- Implement a linear classifier for the Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset.
- Explore both perceptron and logistic regression.
- Evaluate models using the provided skeleton code.

### Question 2: Image Classification with an Autodiff Toolkit
- Implement image classification using PyTorch.
- Implement a linear model with logistic regression.
- Implement a feed-forward neural network with varying hyperparameters.

### Question 3: Multi-layer Perceptron with Quadratic Activations
- Work with a feed-forward neural network with a quadratic activation function.
- Examine how this choice of activation impacts the model.
- Delve into univariate regression tasks and explore internal representations.

## Datasets
1. **Kuzushiji-MNIST**: Contains handwritten cursive images of characters from the Hiragana writing system.

## Instructions
1. Start by downloading the dataset using `download_kuzushiji_mnist.py`.
2. Follow the instructions within each Python file for specific tasks.

### `download_kuzushiji_mnist.py`
This script allows you to:
- Download the Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset.
- Save the dataset to a compressed `.npz` file which can be loaded by `hw1-q2.py` and `hw1-q3.py`.

### `hw1-q1.py`
Skeleton code for:
- Classification tasks using perceptron, logistic regression, and the multi-layer perceptron.
- Implementations are done using numpy.

### `hw1-q2.py`
Skeleton code for:
- Classification tasks using logistic regression and the multi-layer perceptron.
- Implementations are done using Pytorch.
