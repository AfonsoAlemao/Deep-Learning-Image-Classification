# Deep-Learning-Image-Classification

**Authors**: Afonso Alem√£o, Rui Daniel

## Overview
This project aims to provide hands-on experience with various fundamental techniques in deep learning, particularly focusing on image classification and multi-layer perceptrons.

## Content
### Question 1: Image Classification with Linear Classifiers and Neural Networks
- Implement a linear classifier for the Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset.
- Explore both perceptron and logistic regression.
- Evaluate models using provided skeleton code.

### Question 2: Image Classification with an Autodiff Toolkit
- Implement image classification using PyTorch.
- Implement a linear model with logistic regression.
- Implement a feed-forward neural network with varying hyperparameters.

### Question 3: Multi-layer Perceptron with Quadratic Activations
- Work with a feed-forward neural network with a quadratic activation function.
- Examine how this choice of activation impacts the model.
- Delve into univariate regression tasks and explore internal representations.

## Datasets
1. **Kuzushiji-MNIST**: Contains handwritten cursive images of characters from the Hiragana writing system.
